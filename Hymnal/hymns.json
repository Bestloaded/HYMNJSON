				"Through the valley and shadow of death though I stray, Since Thou art my Guardian no evil I fear; Thy rod shall defend me, Thy staff be my stay; <b>No harm can befall, with my Comforter near. :,:</b>",
				"In the midst of affliction my table is spread; With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o’er; With perfume and oil Thou annointest my head; <b>O what shall I ask of Thy providence more? :,:</b>",
				"Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God, Still follow my steps till I meet Thee above; I seek by the path which my forefathers trod, <b>Through the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love. :,:</b>"

				"There is turmoil all around us, Many trials these latter days; May the Lord yet guard and guide us, Bless with grace His Church always. When surrounded by temptation, Fears and doubts rising within; Here we find sweet consolation, And remission for our sin.",
				"Come, all, thank the King of glory, For the victory He has brought; From the garden to Golgatha, Bloody footsteps He has trod. Come, behold in faith His suffering, Dying anguish He has borne. When world’s vanity would tempt us, There behold His crown of thorn.",
				"We have no firm place of dwelling, While in this abode of clay; But the soul with expectation, Views the homeland where we may, Dwell with God in heaven’s brightness, With the faithful, gone before; By His grace and love so boundless, We shall reach that glorious shore."

				"Then hope my feeble spirit, And be thou undismayed; God helps in every trial, And makes thee unafraid. Await God’s time with pleasure, Then shall thine eyes behold, The sun of joy and gladness, His brightest beams unfold.",
				"Thou child of truth, how blessed! A conqueror soon shalt be, With songs of glad thanksgiving, A crown awaiteth thee. To thee the palm triumphal, By God’s own hand is given, Thine, to His name who saved thee, To sing the songs of heaven."

				"When afflictions sore oppress you, Low with grief and anguish bowed, Then to earnest prayer address you, Prayer will help you through the cloud. Still to see your Savior near, Under every cross you bear, By the light His word doth lend you, Prayer will joy and comfort send you.",
				"None shall ever be confounded, Who in God will freely trust; Though they be by woes surrounded, God’s a rock to all the just; Though you deem He hears you not, Still your wants are ne’er forgot; Cry to Him when storms assail you, Let your courage never fail you.",
				"Call on God, knock, seek, implore Him, ’Tis the Christian’s noblest skill; He who comes with faith before Him, Meets with help and favor still; Who on God most firmly rest, Are the wisest and The best; God will with such strength imbue them, Ne’er shall any foe subdue them.",
				"Learn to mark God’s wondrous dealing, With the people that He loves; When His chastening hand they’re feeling, Then their faith the strongest proves; God is nigh and notes their tears, Though He answers not, He hears; Pray with faith, for though He try you, No good thing can God deny you.",
				"Ponder all God’s truth can teach you, Let His word your footsteps guide; Satan’s wiles shall never reach you, Though he draw the world aside: Lo! God’s truth is thy defense, Light, and hope, and confidence; Trust in God, He’ll not deceive you, Pray, and all your foes will leave you."
